'''
    "yesterday": [] on first day, otherwise a 2D list, where each element is
        [c_1, c_2, ..., c_10] for a specific player.
        The order of the players remains consistent in this list.
    "scores": A list of all playersâ€™ current total money made.
        The order of the players here matches that of "yesterday".
    "my_index": Which index into the above lists you are.

# OUTPUT FORMAT (per turn):
'''
    "buys": A list [c_1, c_2, ..., c_10] of how many of each coin
        you would like to purchase, which must be non-negative integers
        summing to at most 100.
